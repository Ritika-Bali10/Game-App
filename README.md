# Game-App
Tic-Tac-Toe game app, developed by using Java in Android Studio. The App has four screens including user/payer  registration screen ,user login screen , main game screen and a GIF screen thanking user for playing the game. I used firebase as a database to store user's data.
Below are the screenshots of the app.
